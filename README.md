My project uses augmented reality to make exercise more fun, through using computer vision to track body outline, telling the user wheather they got the exercise right or not and awarding points based on wheather they did the exercises right or not. My app tracks 3 different exercises: pullups, situps and jumping jacks. Whenever a user performs a pose correctly the app will show the user that they did it right. The accuracy of the exeercises are based on wheather or not the users have performed miovements with body parts that correlate with the exercise correctly.
